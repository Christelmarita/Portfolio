                    <p>This was my final project of year one studying Front End Development. This project was a culmination of what we have learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript, UX, SEO and CMS. The brief was to create a blog site, fetching posts from WordPress using and api call. All design is created by me.</p>

                    <p>This project was one of our first projects during my first year studying Front End. I was first tasked with designing a site according to a given brief. Later on in my studies I had to code it using HTML and CSS. Finally I was tasked with adding Javascript to make it functional. This was a process spanning over a whole school year.</p>

                    <p>Semester Project during my first year as a Front End student. The brief was to create a page for "Community Science Museum". It is built using only HTML and CSS.
                        All design, including logo, were created by me. This was my first project where I designed and then coded my design as a whole project.

                    <h4>My name is Christel, and I am the founder of Onibo Design.</h4>
                    <p>I call Bergen, Norway my hometown. However, I currently reside in Larvik, where I am pursuing my dreams as a UI designer. While I already have a strong foundation in this field, I am now delving into the world of front-end development to expand my skills and capabilities.</p>
                    <p>What truly ignites my passion is creating designs that are not only visually stunning but also accessible to all users. I firmly believe that design should take people on a journey, providing them with an immersive and inclusive experience. It brings me immense satisfaction to know that my work can positively impact the lives of others.</p>
                    <p>Beyond my work, I have three passions. Firstly, thereÂ´s animals. All of them. I find joy in showing compassion and love to all animals.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, weight training is essential to me. It not only benefits my physique but also builds mental resilience. Pushing boundaries and achieving goals empowers me both in and out of the gym, reminding me of the amazing potential of the human body.</p>
                    <p>Last but not least, design is not just a career path for me; it's an all-encompassing passion. I am constantly seeking inspiration, experimenting with new techniques, and pushing the boundaries of my creativity. It brings me immense joy to see my ideas come to life and leave a lasting impact on the end-user.</p>
